# Cryptography-simple-exchange-algorithm-XOR-
XOR-exchange (English Xor swap algorithm) is an algorithm that uses a bitwise XOR operation (exclusive "or") to exchange values ​​between variables containing data of the same type, without using an additional (temporary) variable. The solution to the problem is provided by the self-reversibility property of XOR: A XOR A = 0 for all A.
